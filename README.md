### This is a (work in progress) rewrite of my personal website using Blazor WebAssembly.

The code in this repository is not meant to be a theme template nor cloned or deployed, its for my own personal use, if it helps you, feel free to take whatever inspiration you want from it.
With that being said, i will not provide any kind of documentation or guidance for this project.

# The idea
As part of my process to learn Blazor Web Assembly, i will be creating a static blog that mimics how [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) works (or at least tries to).
